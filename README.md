# BanManager
This plugin is under heavy development!

## Pre release
Commands:
- /ban &lt;player&gt; &lt;time&gt; [reason]
- /ban-ip &lt;ip&gt; &lt;time&gt; [reason]
- /pardon &lt;player&gt;
- /pardon-ip &lt;ip&gt;
- /mute &lt;player&gt; &lt;time&gt; [reason]
- /unmute &lt;player&gt;

Note that this is **a pre-release version** of BanManager, there are still a lot of features to implement, also MySQL support is not included in pre-release version.
